I found this file called "tangents.png". There's a few files like this sitting in my images folder. One is called "Information", another "I am original". Those are pretty good names for unfinished comics but this one is particularly funny because I can only assume it was going to be about getting distracted by stuff. I guess I got distracted by stuff and never finished it. In a way I guess you could say that it *is* finished. Whoa.
