<h3>About Down The Sun Goes</h3>
I wanted to publish the shiny new site at 22:22, but as you can see from the timestamp on this post I'm not going to finish writing in time. It would have been a hollow victory anyway, as all the dates on this site are entered manually. I actually started creating this post at 22:20. I set the time to be one minute off from both 20 and 22 purely to spite *you* personally.

Somehow it ended up being 3am, I'll finish writing this later. The timestamp is staying though.

Also holy crap the layout of this page is such a mess why does everything require so much effort.
ples fix it for me:
